            <h2><strong>Bears</strong></h2>

              h yes..<a href="https://www.chicagobears.com/" target="_blank">Bears.</a> 
              Typically a light-hearted animal with a lot to say.
              As far as taking care of them, just dont worry!
              Thats right, these giant <strong>MONSTERS</strong> are actually huge cuddlers.
              Just look at some famous lovable, bears from the past: <i>Smokey, Yogi, and Teddy</i>.
              We here at <strong><i>Totally SuperSafe Zoo</i></strong>, 
              have followed the naming convention of ending bear names in a vowel.
              Just remember, the term "Bear Hug" came from these silly, billies hugging the depression
              out of adventures on <i>The Oregon Trail</i></p>

            <h2><strong>Giraffes</strong></h2>
            <p>"<a href="https://dosomething.org/article/11-facts-about-giraffes" target="_blank">Giraffes</a> are my favorite animal!"
                That's what I would <i>maybe</i> say, if I had never seen another animal.
                These long-necked, knobby-knee, extendo-donkeys are not very nice.
                Have you seen the way they run?</p>

            <p>Foolish. Additionally, don't worry to much about them. Except Coconut.</p>
            <p>And Frankie on a bad day...</p>
            <br>
            <p>which is everyday for a giraffe.</p>
            <p>It's also spelled weird.</p>

            <p>Here are some facts about Lions</p>
           <p><strong>1)</strong> They are the first to be listed when talking about "oh my" inducing animals</p>
           <p><strong>B.</strong> Gender roles are clearly defined</p>
           <p><strong>Finally</strong> nothing to fear.
            As this <a href=https://youtu.be/z2itQkiQUOE target="_blank">documentary</a> will now demonstrate.</p>

            <h2><strong>Monkeys</strong></h2>
            <p>Woof.. I'm getting tapped out. Lets just agree that I did a good job on these other ones and deserve to phone it in on these last two.</p>
            <p>Alright<a href="https://support.chimphaven.org/a/signup?ms=googlepaid&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=LGRTOct24&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3vO3BhCqARIsAEWblcACwQe64BRCIURHQ8LU2yc9G1NHdiImNDdMnMdYNLcCDQTsQN0KkIsaAjLZEALw_wcB" target="_blank"> Monkey.</a>
            Do whatever you want with the animals at this point. We haven't had insurance since we started and I'm really just looking for any reason to shut this place down.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Oh, you want a picture? What? Don't know what a monkey looks like?</p>

            <h2><strong>Alligators</strong></h2>
            <p>Alright<a href="https://floridagators.com/" target="_blank"> Alligators</a>...These are not actually in our zoo. They hang out in the staff ditches and break room. They have names that we tried to make short, but you probably wont have time to say it before they get you.
               Not a whole lot to add. Be safe or something, I guess.
